## System Architecture

The Open Trading platform has three main components

1. UI
2. API
3. ENGINE
4. TradingView widgets

The **UI** is available at [https://github.com/blocknomic-technologies/open-trading-platform-UI](https://github.com/blocknomic-technologies/open-trading-platform-UI) repository that contains all the code for the frontend which is displayed on browser. The **UI** requires both the **API** and the **ENGINE** to operate properly. 

The **API** available at [https://github.com/blocknomic-technologies/open-trading-platform-API](https://github.com/blocknomic-technologies/open-trading-platform-API) repository that contains all the platforms Api's and can work independantly from the other two components. It can be used by developers for programming their own system and function for automation.

The **ENGINE** is currently being run by us. It's a simple aggregator engine that complies all the different exchanges ticker/market data and displays it for users to use to choose their currency pair and comparing market rates etc. The **ENGINE** will be open sourced in future dates after cleaning up of the code. 

The **TRADING VIEW WIDGETS** are also currently being run by us. If you wish to run it on your own follow the instruction on https://github.com/blocknomic-technologies/open-trading-platform-TradingView/blob/master/README.md 


## Getting Started

The platform has been designed and built for two types of users Traders with no development experience and Traders/Developers with basic development experience below we will give you the different options to run the system. There are 3 ways to start the system.

 1. [Headless (Easy)](#headless)
 2. [Full (Medium)](#full)
 3. [Download (Easiest)](#download)

### Headless

Headless allows the developer to run the platform without running the UI on there computer. They can simply use https://trader.opentradingplatform.org to connect the server running on their computer. 

#### Requirements

1. Node.js V8.9.0+
2. NPM
3. git

Download node.js and NPM at [https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

Download Git at [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

For Development environments...
  ```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/blocknomic-technologies/open-trading-platform-API.git
$ cd open-trading-platform-API
$ npm install
(In the root directory search and edit the keys.js file and input your API keys for the exchanges)
(To run simply type)
$ node debug.js
(open up https://trader.opentradingplatform.org) and see if you are connected. 
```

For Production environment (Coming soon)

### Full
Running the full system could get heavy that is why we recommend using Head Less. But if you are looking to overhaul the system and test out all the feature there are two main part to running it. 

##### Requirements

1. Node.js V8.9.0+
2. NPM
3. Vue.js V2.5.13+ ( Have not tested in later version, but shouldn't be an issue)
4. Git

Download node.js and NPM at [https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)


Download Git at [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

For Development environments...
  ```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/blocknomic-technologies/open-trading-platform-API.git
$ cd open-trading-platform-API
$ npm install
(In the root directory search for the keys.js file and input your API keys for the exchanges)
(To run simply type)
$ node debug.js
```

after downloading and running the server get out of the API root directory and follow the below instructions to run the UI. 

  ```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/blocknomic-technologies/open-trading-platform-UI.git
